ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mae. Im a full-stack web developer. 
My repos are some of the projects I worked on during my time at Dev Academy. 
They were used to practice/learn skills being taught during the course.
My intrest in coding stems from wanting to understand how things work and why they work. It's been an interest of mine since I was young. Dev academy was the first formal education in this subject I have studied but I have coded on and off for years.
